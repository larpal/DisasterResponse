## Project Motivation
This project was done within the framework of the [Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) offered by Udacity.
The goals of the project are:
1. To build an ETL pipeline extracting information from a dataset of text messages and loading it into an SQL database
2. To build a machine learning pipeline to predict to which categories each message belongs
3. To build a web application where new messages can be entered and classified and some 
graphics containing information about the data et are displayed.

## Data Set
The data set contains text messages related to natural disasters. The file 
`disaster_messages.csv` contains 26248 text messages in english (partly translated) as 
well as an original language. A second file *disaster_categories.csv* contains binary
labels for 36 categories (such as *floods* or *storms*). Each text message may belong
to multiple categories.
